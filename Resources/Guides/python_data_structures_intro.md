# Python Workshop: Collections and Iteration

Today we will be learning about two foundational topics in programming:

  - **Collections** are a class of data types that gather together conceptually related data into a whole.  For example, we could have a list of numbers, or a set of strings.  We will discuss three main types of collections today: *lists*, *tuples*, *sets*, and *dictionaries*.

  - **Iteration** is the process of visiting each member of a collection, and taking an action on it.  For example, we could visit all the strings in a list and join the various words into a sentence, or we could visit all the numbers in a set and calculate the sum of them all.

We will be introducing these two important concepts together, as they tend to depend upon and enhance one another.  Here is the overall plan:

#### Lists

  - Introduce Lists.
  - What can go in lists?
  - Indexing and slicing into a list.
  - The `in` operator.
  - `for` loops, and visiting all the elements in a list.
  - Building a list incrementally using `append`.
  - Searching and `break`
  - Mutability of lists, index assignment.
  - Looping over files.

#### Tuples

  - Mutability of lists.
  - Wat's with the mutability of lists.
  - Tuples: immutable lists.

#### Sets

  - Introduce sets.
  - Visiting all the elements in a set.
  - Operations on sets.
  - Building a set incrementally with `add`.
  - The `in` operator.
  - Efficiency of sets vs. lists: why have both?
  - Solving problems with sets.

#### Dictionaries

  - Lists of tuples as key-value pairs.
  - Introduce dictionaries.
  - Indexing into a dictionary and `.get`.
  - Building a dictionary incrementally.
  - Efficiency of dictionaries vs. lists of tuples.
  - Restrictions on dictionary keys.
  - Solving problems with dictionaries.
  

## Lists

### Introduce Lists

  - List literal notation `[...]`.
  - What can go in lists?
  - Length of a list.

### Indexing and Slicing a List

  - Indexing into a list.


###  The `in` operator.

  - Checking containment with the `in` operator.


Note: We will later develop much better ways to signal errors.

### `for` loops, and visiting all the elements in a list.

  - For loops, and visiting all the elements in a list.
  - The accumlator pattern: summing a list.



### Searching and `break`

  - Searching a list with the `break` statement.


###  Mutability of lists, index assignment.

  - Index assignment.
  - Mutability, WUT.


### Looping over Files

  - The `with` statment and `open`.
  - Looping through an open file line by line.



### Tuples

  - Mutability of lists.
  - Wat's with the mutability of lists.
  - Tuples: immutable lists.



## Sets

### Introduce sets.

  - Set literal notation.
  - Unordered collections.


### Visiting all the elements in a set.
### Operations on sets.

  - The union of two sets.
  - The intersection of two sets.
  - The difference of two sets.


### Building a set incrementally with `add`.

  - The `.add` method and the builder pattern.
  - Yup, this means sets are mutable.


### The `in` operator.

  - Efficiency of the `in` operator for lists vs. sets.
  - Reading in a file.
  - Checking whether a word is in a book, list vs. set.



## Dictionaries

### Introduce Dictionaries

  - Dictionary literal notation.

### Indexing into a Dictionary

  - Looking up by key.


### Efficiency of dictionaries vs. lists of tuples.

### The `.get` Method and `in`


### Building a Dictionary Incrementally

  - Creating empty dictionaries
  - Building a dictionary incrementally


### Restrictions on Dictionary Keys


### Looping over dictionaries.

  - Looping over the keys in a dictionaries
  - Other looping options: python 2 vs. python 3
