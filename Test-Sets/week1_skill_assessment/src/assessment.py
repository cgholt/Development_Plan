    Implement a simple multi-armed bandit testing algorithm for a set of fake
    slot machines. There will be 3 slot machines, and the deciding threshold
    will be (episilon). The function will accept a pyton dictionary where each
    key represents the slot machine name and the values are a list of rewards
    representing the reward gain from that machine for each run. The goal is to 
    return the total sum reward after all trial runs

    INPUT:

        e.g.: d = {'S1':[0,5,4,6,3],

# For each of these, your python function should return a string that is the
# SQL statement which answers the question.  
#
# For example:

#
# You may want to test your queries using sqlite3 or postgresql.  Both
# databases - markets.sqlite (sqlite3) and markets.sql (postgreSQL) are in the
# dsi-assessment-day1/data directory.  Testing your queries with sqlite3 or
# postgresql is optional.  See the SQL instructions in the README.md if you
# want to do this.
#
# There are two tables in the database with these columns:
#
# statepopulations: state, pop2010, pop2000
#
# farmersmarkets: FMID, MarketName, Website, Street, City,
#    County, State, WIC, WICcash
#    (plus other columns we don't care about for this exercise)
#
# Note: FMID is a unique id for the farmers market.  WIC is a boolean varaible
# that indicates if the market accepts payments from the WIC government
# program.   WICCash is another boolean for a slightly different program.
