Concepts Assessment

*Note*: Responses do not need to be extensive. Explain where you it is necessary, but 
simplified / general answers will suffice, unless the question is asking for a specific calculation or definition

1. What is the derivative of 10e^x2?


2. What is the variance of the vector: [0,8,3,5,7,3,2,6,8,9,10,15]?


3. What is a confidence interval?


4. What is a Type 1 vs Type 2 error?


5. What is a p-value? How do you interpret the value?


6. What is Bayes Conditional probability?


7. What is the difference between an independent-sample vs paired-sample t-test?


8. Flipping a fair coin 3 times, which has a higher probability of occurring first (or neither)?
    a. HTT
    b. HTH


9. Nathan makes 60% of his free-throw attempts. If he shoots 12 free throws, what is the probability that he makes exactly 10?
(hint, use binomial distribution - feel free to use a python library, and paste code below if you do)


10. What is bootstrapping? How do you bootstrap a sample?


11. What are the assumptions of linear regression?


12. How do you calculate:
    a. Precision

    b. Accuracy

    c. Recall

    d. ROC plot



13. What calculations are required to be made at each split of a decision tree algorithm?


14. What parameter(s) is (are) randomized in a Random Forest classifier?


15. What is gradient boosting & why is it useful?


16. How do you determine the appropriate amount of clusters for a clustering algorithm like Kmeans or KNN?


17. What is collaborative filtering? What is the difference betwen user- & item-based collaborative filtering?


18. What is the bias-variance trade off? What does this tell us during the model development process?


19. Briefly explain forward & back-propagation in neural networks (generally, or mathematically)


20. Give one common use case for each of the following types of neural network frameworks
    a. CNN

    b. Autoencoder

    c. LSTM

    d. GAN



21. What is the difference between a relational & a non-relational database?


22. What is a virtual machine? How do you create/access one?


23. What is Spark? Why is it considered superior than its predecessor (HDFS/MapReduce)?


24. What is an API?


25. What does a productionized ML-model life cycle look like?
