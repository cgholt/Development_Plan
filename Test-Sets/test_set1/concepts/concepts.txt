Concepts Assessment

##############################################################################################################################
All of the concepts tested below are absolutely essential to (1) passing data science interviews, 
(2) understanding foundations of more complex topics, and (3) success as a data scientist. Each of
these topics are commonly asked about in both conceptual & code-based knowledge testing interviews
for data scientist positions. 

Responses do not need to be extensive. Explain where you feel it is necessary, but 
simplified / general answers will suffice, unless the question is asking for a specific calculation or definition
