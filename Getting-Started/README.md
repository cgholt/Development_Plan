# 1. Computer Set Up
The following items incude those that should be considered when setting up your computer for data science. For most items, there is (will be) a linked guide that can be found under the "Resoruces > Guides " directory in this repository.The items include:

    1a. Applications to Download/Install - You may choose your preferred editor, but VSCode is the tool I and many software developers use. Others include Spyder, PyCharm, etc You may also wish to install GitHub Desktop, or any other tools of choice for more convenient workflows. 
        - VSCode (or preferred editor)
        - Github Desktop

    1b. Environment set up - The follow list includes required or optional installs for data science in general as wellas completion of this mentorship. You will be required to use python 3.X, preferably â‰¥ python 3.6X. Python can be installed via Anaconda (recommended for beginners and learners), or through homebrew. MacOS can hold more than 1 installation of python, while on Windows, python must be upgraded when desired. The list of essential packages to install should be intalled right away, if not existent. To check if they are installed, try:
    ``bash
    pip3 freeze
    ```

    Note: Virtual environments (using Virtualenv or recommended pyenv) is highly recommended, but not required. See Guides directory for how to setup a virtual environment for a project.

# 2. Need To Knows
The items below include either workflows, skills or knwowledge sets that you will need to be comfortable with during mentorship. It is okay if you are not completely fluent at the start, but if that is the case, review should be done very early to catch up and get the most out of mentorship. The items include:

    - Navigating your computer with terminal
    - Launching & utilizing Jupyter notebooks
    - Interacting with Github & using the git command-line workflow
    - Basic principles of python
    - Good undertanding of Calculus, including linear algebra, partial derivatives, etc.
